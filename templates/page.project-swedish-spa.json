and med spa clinic in Seattle, WA. <\/p><p><br\/>To create a calming, high-end spa atmosphere, Swedish invested in five original artworks by three artists for their reception areas. The artworks elevate the design and feel of the clinic, while connecting deeply with patients through the artists’ stories. This point of connection was particularly important in the cancer care wing, where the artists’ healing journeys are front and center, offering comfort and deepening the emotional resonance of the patient experience. <\/p><p><br\/>The thoughtful investment generated nearly $20,000 in income for ArtLifting artists.
