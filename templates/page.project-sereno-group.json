We are passionate about supporting our community. For years, we have given 1% of our gross commissions to community charities. <\/p><p><br\/>When we heard about ArtLifting it was a no-brainer. ArtLifting provided us the opportunity to have beautiful, inspirational artwork while supporting our community and making their values visible.<\/p><p><strong><br\/>Samantha Elrite:<\/strong> When Artlifting was first brought to my attention and I was tasked with looking into Artlifting as an organization and a vendor I quickly became very excited; It was so in line with what lies at the heart of Sereno. I spent hours looking through the vast catalog of art on the website and fell in love with not just the artwork but the mission behind it all.<\/p><h5><strong>What effect has the art had on your team?<\/strong><\/h5><p><strong><br\/>SE:<\/strong> The Bay Area has some of the largest unhoused populations in the nation; it’s staggering and saddening to see, especially when we live in a place with so much wealth. I think for our staff and agents to see these beautiful works of art and be able to connect it to a person living in their own communities, with amazing stories, it just adds whole other layer of depth and beauty to the artwork. I see people reading the plaques next to each piece all the time, and I just know they feel inspired inside because that’s how I feel each time I read them as well.<\/p><p><br\/>I had the immense pleasure of connecting with one of the artists we purchased from, Tim Strouss, because it turns out he lives not too far from me in San Jose, and have him walk me through his whole artistic process. We talked for hours about how the art came to him as a means of coping after his paralysis, how he stretches the canvas with his feet since he has limited mobility and strength in his arms, and how his work progressed and began to take on new meanings for him. I could see suddenly see the pain, and healing, in each of his artworks; it was truly inspiring.<\/p><h5><strong>Does the work inspire clients and colleagues?<\/strong><\/h5><p><br\/><strong>SE:<\/strong> I have no doubt the work speaks to anyone who sees them or takes the time to read each story. It’s a wonderful conversation starter and a great segue for our agents to delve into some of the other organizations and programs that Sereno works with.<\/p><h5><strong>Would you recommend ArtLifting?<\/strong><\/h5><p><br\/><strong>BC:<\/strong> I would highly recommend ArtLifting. They transform lives. Working with them was incredibly easy. The team is professional and we appreciate them giving us the opportunity to display beautiful works of art done by beautiful people.<\/p><p><strong><br\/>SE:<\/strong> I very much enjoyed working with ArtLifting. They make the process simple and offer all kinds of assistance. It was great to know that each person we worked with from ArtLifting was passionate about what they were doing.
