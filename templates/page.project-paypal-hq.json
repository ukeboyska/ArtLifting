We were super excited to connect our missions about democratizing financial services and serving the underserved. The link between PayPal and ArtLifting is just unmissable. The art is made by the very people PayPal are trying to reach and empower.<\/p><h5><strong>What made you choose ArtLifting over other “traditional” art companies?<\/strong><\/h5><p><em><br\/><\/em>The difference with ArtLifting is that it is all about social awareness, bringing the spirit of what PayPal is quintessentially trying to do into the workplace, as well as providing a beautiful piece of art for people to look at. ArtLifting has this “elevated” level that a regular piece of art can’t ever hit for us.<\/p><h5><strong>How has the experience of working with ArtLifting been?<\/strong><\/h5><p><em><br\/><\/em>This has been an exciting collaboration — because that’s what it is, a collaboration. Since we first connected, about a year ago, everything has been “here’s what we want to achieve… can we do it with ArtLifting?” Everything has been “absolutely, yes.” It’s actually removed a lot of office politics and arguments about colors and taste and art styles people prefer. They see the pieces and connect with the artists’ stories and they just love it.<\/p><h5><strong>What has been the reaction from PayPal employees?<\/strong><\/h5><p><em><br\/><\/em>There’s been a sense of being given a “gift” of art in the workplace… that senior management values how we feel at work so much that they will spend money on art. We’ve put ArtLifting into our Scottsdale office, the executive office in San Jose, the VP’s office in Timonium… we’re putting ArtLifting as many places as we possibly can, working towards getting the art globally. We get really positive feedback after every install, especially including the informational plaques about ArtLifting’s mission and how it ties in with PayPal’s mission. People have just loved it, from employees to customers and partners. It’s lifted our space with color and story. It’s a major talking point with visitors and clients.
