HPE was seeking a way to enhance employee experience by engaging their team members and celebrating cultural connections and observances. ArtLifting's art rotation program provides HPE an opportunity to visibly accomplish these goals within the workplace environment. <\/p><p><br\/>Leaders desired to highlight artists whose stories and perspectives reflect themes including,  mental health, LGBTQ+ Pride, Asian Pacific Islander heritage, and veterans. For HPE, the turnkey rotation program enhances their talent approach, with art providing a tangible avenue to promote a more inclusive and accessible workplace culture.<\/p><p><br\/>HPE’s Culture & Engagement team noted their interest in creating interactive moments around the art program with an unveiling event featuring an ArtLifting artist the company is supporting. <\/p><p><br\/>In early 2025, HPE held an employee engagement event at its headquarters to celebrate the rotation program. HPE invited ArtLifting artist Damiano Austin to speak at the event and share her story with HPE employees. During the event, Rasheda Carter, HR Leader at HPE, reflected on the program, sharing, “This is just another part of our story that we can tell here at HPE.” HPE also produced a video of the event, giving their global team the opportunity to connect with Damiano’s story while highlighting the impact of their partnership with ArtLifting.<\/p><p><br\/>The decision to invest in an art rotation program reflects HPE’s commitment to offering employees enriching experiences while showcasing art that resonates with both their workforce and leadership. <\/p>","text_size":4,"text_columns":1}}},"block_order":["heading_BKPaEp","text_igWW9A"],"name":"Rich text","settings":{"align_text":"text-left","text_color":"text--neutral","bg":"palette--light bg--neutral","content_width":850,"width":"wrapper","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"section_video_player_TNyX9Y":{"type":"section-video-player","name":"Video","settings":{"video_link":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=80HxPu-jhaA","width":"wrapper","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"section_richtext_8N4fUc":{"type":"section-richtext","blocks":{"text_nwbWn8":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>Images<\/strong><\/p><p>1.
