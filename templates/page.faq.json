The community of ArtLifting artists is also incredibly diverse. We generally use person-first language as a standard as ArtLifting artists have communicated this preference. We will accommodate requests for preferred language as long as it is in line with ArtLifting’s values. <\/p><p>Represented artists are surveyed regularly in addition to ArtLifting’s CEO meeting with our Artist Advisory Board to gain insights into the community’s preferences regarding language in addition to other pertinent topics. The Advisory Board is comprised of 6 artists at a time.<\/p><p>Artist bios on the ArtLifting website are written in partnership with each artist to reflect their language preferences, which can vary by individual. Artists approve the language that appears in their bios, on artwork plaques, and provide ArtLifting with guidance and permission for how to share details about their unique lived experiences. We believe it’s important to recognize and honor individual language preferences.<\/p><p>One of our favorite resources regarding language and disability is <a href=\"https:\/\/emilyladau.com\/book\/\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><em>Demystifying Disability: What to Know, What to Say, and How to be an Ally<\/em><\/span><\/a> by Emily Ladau.
