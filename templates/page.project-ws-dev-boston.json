Rudolph designed the concept for the piece and collaborated with fabricators to translate his vision into reality. The final 20’x20’ installation is the result of an inclusive collaboration between Rudolph, skilled fabricators, and local installers. <\/p><p><br\/>The colorful, geometric masterpiece captures the attention of everyone who enters the building's main lobby. “I’m honored to have my vision come to life in such a monumental way,” Rudolph shared, reflecting on the journey that led him to be part of a groundbreaking project.<\/p><p><br\/><a href=\"https:\/\/www.artlifting.com\/collections\/christina-constantine\" title=\"https:\/\/www.artlifting.com\/collections\/christina-constantine\">Christina Constantine's<\/a> series of commissioned watercolor paintings adds a burst of bold colors to the second-floor lobby.
