These pieces now grace the 30th and 31st executive floors of Wells Fargo’s 3 Wells Fargo office in Charlotte, North Carolina—a 32-story tower encompassing approximately 930,733 square feet, making it one of the largest office buildings in the city by leasable square footage. Among the featured artists, seven are women, and five are Black, reflecting a broad spectrum of underrepresented voices in corporate art collections.<br\/><br\/>The inclusion of didactic labels, complete with braille, adds an educational layer to the installation while ensuring that the art is accessible to everyone. This inclusive approach not only highlights the value of diverse perspectives but also reinforces Wells Fargo’s dedication to creating an environment where everyone belongs.<\/p><p><br\/>Corporate art collections are often hyper focus on regions, are the result of significant investments in ‘blue chip’ artists, or are inherited from business acquisitions. Over the past decade, there has been a push to diversify corporate art collections to better reflect the national and global communities these businesses serve. <\/p><p><br\/>One essential element of corporate art diversification is a focus on abilities. Artists with disabilities have always existed, however as reported by the New York Times, art institutions like SFMOMA have only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/07\/arts\/design\/creative-growth-disability-sfmoma.html\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">recently begun acquiring work<\/span><\/a> from talented disabled artists. ArtLifting is proud to bridge the often underappreciated talents of artists with disabilities with corporate collection curators.<\/p>","text_size":4,"text_columns":1}},"text_taUrKB":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<h5>Impact on Artists: A Life-Changing Opportunity<\/h5><p><br\/>For the artists involved, this collaboration with Wells Fargo through ArtLifting is more than just a professional achievement; it’s a tranformative personal experience. <\/p><p><br\/><a href=\"\/collections\/yvette\" title=\"Yvette\">Yvette<\/a>, a 20-year Army veteran living with PTSD, visited the executive floors to see her artwork. She expressed disbelief and gratitude at seeing her abstract paintings on display near work by Andy Warhol. “I never would’ve thought it,” she said. “My paintings hanging near Warhol? I’m just blessed. I thank everybody.”<\/p><p><br\/>Cheryl Kinderknecht, another artist featured in the collection, shared how the acquisition impacted her daily life. “My sales total this month exceeded my art sales from all sources for the year to date. That's a game changer in terms of my budget,” she said. “Wells Fargo’s generosity of spirit in partnering with ArtLifting has a very direct and positive impact on the lives and livelihood of artists like myself.”<\/p><p><br\/>Ronnie, another artist whose work was selected, echoed this sentiment: “I feel absolutely honored to have my art displayed in a worldwide organization that has supported community and social causes.”<\/p><p><br\/>ArtLifting curates work by talented disabled artists and makes them available to corporate buyers. Artists earn 55% of profits from the sale of artwork directly, making significant impacts on their lives and providing financial security. Because many ArtLifting artists cannot work traditional jobs or rely on social services, the income from print sales and original artwork acquisitions can be life-changing.<\/p>","text_size":4,"text_columns":1}},"spacer_pk7pDP":{"type":"spacer","settings":{"spacer_padding":40,"show_line":false}},"text_jeyrnn":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<h5>A New Approach to Workplace Design<\/h5><p><br\/>The success of this project highlights the importance of looking beyond traditional sources when selecting art for corporate spaces. <\/p><p><br\/>Abbie Wilson and Emily van Zyl, construction portfolio managers based in Charlotte, played a key role in curating the collection. “Anyone who has visited the space has given positive remarks about the art,” Wilson noted. “It’s beautiful and works with the overall design. More than that, we think the lesson we learned is applicable to everyone at the company — you don’t have to look in the usual places to find great things.”<\/p><p><br\/>The inclusion of artwork by contemporary artists with disabilities in the executive offices as well as the Wells Fargo has an impact on workplace culture as well as aesthetics. The innovative artwork sparks creativity while simultaneously educating about diverse lived experiences. <\/p><p><br\/>In collaborative spaces like conference rooms and hallways, art sparks conversations about identity and experience, providing an springboard for building a meaningful and authentic culture of inclusion. <\/p><p><br\/>ArtLifting’s chief growth officer, Christina Bailey, emphasized the significance of this inclusive art strategy, stating, “Wells Fargo purchasing ArtLifting’s artwork for your collection — and installing it in a newly designed and collaborative space — is incredibly meaningful. You all are differentiating yourselves by saying, ‘We value different perspectives and lived experiences. We value inclusion.’ It’s powerful.”<\/p><h5>A Lasting Impact<\/h5><p><br\/>Through this collaboration, Wells Fargo and ArtLifting are setting a new standard for corporate art collections. By championing the work of artists with disabilities from diverse backgrounds, both organizations are enhancing the workplace with beautiful amenities and making a lasting impact on the lives of working artists. As Liz Powers, co-founder of ArtLifting, put it, “Instead of defining people by their circumstances, we should define them by their talent.”<\/p><p><br\/>This project is a testament to the power of art to bring people together, challenge perceptions, and create a more inclusive world. As more companies follow Wells Fargo’s lead, the future of corporate art collections looks brighter and more diverse than ever before.<\/p>","text_size":4,"text_columns":1}},"text_At6jWh":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p><strong>Images<\/strong><\/p><p>1 - <a href=\"\/collections\/yvette\" title=\"Yvette\">Yvette<\/a> sits in front of one of her paintings alongside a painting by Ronnie.<br\/>2 - <em>Face<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/grace-goad\" title=\"Grace Goad\">Grace Goad<\/a>, Golden <em>Bubbles<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/linda-king\" title=\"Linda King\">Linda King<\/a>, <em>I Am A Ballerina Dancer<\/em> by Clifton Hayes (former artist) hang in a hallway.<br\/>3 - ArtLifting team members Christina Bailey and Addi Spearman stand with <em>10272019<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/sydnee-yates\" title=\"Sydnee Yates\">Sydnee Yates<\/a>.<br\/>4 - <em>Untitled 5<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/yvette\" title=\"Yvette\">Yvette<\/a> hangs near a conference table.<br\/>5 - <em>Fantasies of an Introvert<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/aneliya-kostova\" title=\"Aneliya Kostova\">Aneliya Kostova<\/a> hangs next to inset cafe seating.<br\/>6 - <em>Her<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/yvette\" title=\"Yvette\">Yvette<\/a> hangs in a hallway.<br\/>7 - <a href=\"\/collections\/yvette\" title=\"Yvette\">Yvette<\/a> poses in front of her work.<br\/>8 - <em>Resilience<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/ronnie\" title=\"Ronnie\">Ronnie<\/a> and <em>Leave the Light on, Communities Will Recover<\/em> by <a href=\"\/collections\/yvette\" title=\"Yvette\">Yvette<\/a> hang above storage cabinets.<br\/><\/p>","text_size":4,"text_columns":1}}},"block_order":["text_p3EMxQ","text_taUrKB","spacer_pk7pDP","text_jeyrnn","text_At6jWh"],"settings":{"align_text":"text-left","text_color":"text--neutral","bg":"palette--light bg--neutral","content_width":850,"width":"wrapper","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"section_contact_nRHrHF":{"type":"section-contact","blocks":{"select_QzKLrA":{"type":"select","settings":{"title":"Topic","required":true,"label_one":"General Inquiries","label_two":"Consumer Sales","label_three":"Corporate Sales","label_four":"Artists","label_five":"Partnerships","label_six":""}},"email_KepGKR":{"type":"email","settings":{"title":"Name","required":true}},"text_QzTHDz":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"E-mail","required":true}},"telephone_dV3qVe":{"type":"telephone","settings":{"title":"Phone","required":false}},"text_wE8daA":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"How did you hear about us?","required":false}},"body_4tFmwh":{"type":"body","settings":{"title":"Message","required":true}}},"block_order":["select_QzKLrA","email_KepGKR","text_QzTHDz","telephone_dV3qVe","text_wE8daA","body_4tFmwh"],"settings":{"title":"Let's talk about art!","align_text":"text-left","button_size":"btn--large","button_color":"btn--secondary","button_style":"btn","text_color":"text--neutral","bg":"palette--light bg--neutral","width":"wrapper--narrow","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}},"section_custom_content_Dc8j3k":{"type":"section-custom-content","blocks":{"image_8MHhaF":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Wallcoverings_Stoneleigh_Installation_Photo_Allen_Chamberland_2.jpg","overlay_opacity":25,"overlay_color":"#000000","enable_overlay_text":true,"kicker":"","enable_line":false,"kicker_text_size":5,"title":"Portfolio","richtext":"","text_align":"align--middle-center","text_color":"text--white","link_text":"","link":"https:\/\/www.artlifting.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/Prints_BoA_Installation_Photo_Rudolph_Jean-Louis.jpg?v=1707353806&width=1200","button_color":"btn--white","button_style":"btn"}},"image_nDTXLR":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/020824-Artlifting-Mural-11.jpg","overlay_opacity":25,"overlay_color":"#000000","enable_overlay_text":true,"kicker":"","enable_line":false,"kicker_text_size":5,"title":"Services","richtext":"","text_align":"align--middle-center","text_color":"text--white","link_text":"","link":"https:\/\/www.artlifting.com\/pages\/services","button_color":"btn--white","button_style":"btn"}}},"block_order":["image_8MHhaF","image_nDTXLR"],"settings":{"height":"use_screen_one_half","brick_gutter":12,"borders":false,"vertalign":"valign--middle","bg_color":"","preload_image":false,"width":"wrapper","padding_top":36,"padding_bottom":36}}},"order":["main","section_hero_xXCEGj","section_gallery_tcEqpm","section_custom_content_Tb7Mfj","section_custom_content_DwHGd7","section_richtext_CBpRyR","section_video_player_E3XDKK","section_richtext_qi6VNN","section_contact_nRHrHF","section_custom_content_Dc8j3k"]}
